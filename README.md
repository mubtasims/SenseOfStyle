# Sense of Style

Sense Of Style is a fashion blog portfolio that has been curated for stylish gents who wants to make a statement and express themselves in a classy, exquisite manner.

The portfolio is developed with in HTML, designed with CSS and JavaScript. With the backend and frontend working simultaneously together, the content is hosted on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) which is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance, and projected as a fully functional static website. Next, AWS CodePipeline is used, which is a fully managed continuous delivery service that helps automate the release of pipelines for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. This deployed pipeline is configured so that it continuously delivers files using Amazon S3 as the deployment action provider in the deployment stage. The completed pipeline detects changes when they are made to the source files in the source repository which then uses Amazon S3 to deploy the files to the bucket. Each time website files are added or modified in the source location, the deployment creates the website with the latest files. Then, Route 53 is used which is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service to route a purchased domain to the S3 endpoint in order for the viewers to have an easy to read web address.
